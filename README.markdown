Touchcode includes portions of other code libraries. This code may be supplied under a different license to Touchcode.

Touchcode has changed licenses over the years and as such not all source files reflect the correct license. I hope to fix this situation.

## Sub-Projects Directories

### TouchFoundation

A smorgasbord of lots of relatively stand-alone classes and categories. A lot of the other TouchCode components depend on TouchFoundation.

All source code in this directory should only depend on the Foundation framework. This code is therefore compatible with iPhone and Mac OS X.

This directory was formally merely called "Support".

### TouchJSON

TouchJSON is parser and generator for JSON, implemented in Objective C.

### TouchNotifications

TODO

### TouchRSS

TODO

### TouchUI

TODO

### TouchXML

TouchXML is a lightweight replacement for Cocoa's NSXML* cluster of classes. It is based on the commonly available Open Source libxml2 library.

## Other Directories
